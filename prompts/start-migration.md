I'm migrating from Gatsby to Astro. Old site: /home/toddwseattle/pw-toddwseattle

IMMEDIATE TASKS:

1. Read /home/toddwseattle/pw-toddwseattle/package.json and create an equivalent package.json for Astro with the right dependencies (replace Gatsby packages with Astro equivalents)
2. Read /home/toddwseattle/pw-toddwseattle/tailwind.config.js and /home/toddwseattle/pw-toddwseattle/tsconfig.json - copy these over
3. Create astro.config.mjs with React and Tailwind integrations
4. Create src/content/config.ts to define content collections based on the structure in src/data/
5. Install all dependencies

After that's done, we'll migrate layouts and components.

Start now with task #1.
