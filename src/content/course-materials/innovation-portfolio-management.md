## Overview

Managing innovation at scale requires portfolio thinking—balancing short-term wins with long-term bets, allocating resources strategically, and knowing when to pivot or kill projects.

## Portfolio Framework

- **Horizon 2**: Adjacent opportunities (2-3 years)
- **Horizon 3**: Transformational bets (3-5+ years)

### Resource Allocation

- Adjust based on industry dynamics and competitive pressure
- Balance financial and talent resources

### Stage Gates
