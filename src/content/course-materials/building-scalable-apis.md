## Overview

Building APIs that scale requires understanding performance, caching, versioning, and proper error handling. This tutorial walks through designing robust APIs from scratch.

## Key Concepts

### API Design Principles
- RESTful conventions and best practices
- GraphQL schema design and query optimization
- Versioning strategies (URI vs header-based)
- Documentation and OpenAPI/Swagger

### Performance and Scalability
- Caching strategies (CDN, Redis, in-memory)
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Database query optimization
- Connection pooling

### Security
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth, API keys)
- Authorization and role-based access
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS and security headers

## Hands-On Exercises
