## Overview

Speed matters when validating ideas. This guide covers practical prototyping techniques across different fidelity levels—from paper sketches to functional MVPs—helping you test assumptions fast.

## Prototyping Spectrum

### Low-Fidelity Prototypes

- **Paper sketches** - Fastest feedback on layout and flow
- **Wireframes** - Digital mockups using Figma, Balsamiq
- **Clickable prototypes** - InVision, Marvel for user testing
- **Use case**: Early concept validation, user flow testing

### Medium-Fidelity Prototypes

- **Interactive mockups** - Higher fidelity designs with interactions
- **Wizard of Oz** - Manual backend simulation
- **Concierge MVP** - Human-powered service mimicking product
- **Use case**: Testing user experience and value proposition

### High-Fidelity Prototypes

- **Functional MVP** - Core features with real backend
- **Single-feature release** - One capability fully built
- **Technical spike** - Proving feasibility of key tech
- **Use case**: Market validation, early customers, fundraising

## Prototyping Examples

_Placeholder: Detailed examples will be added covering:_

- Landing page MVP (static site)
- Mobile app prototype (React Native, Flutter)
- Web app MVP (Next.js, Rails)
- API prototype (FastAPI, Express)
- Hardware prototype (3D printing, Arduino)

## Tools and Platforms

### Design Tools

- Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD
- Framer, ProtoPie for advanced interactions

### No-Code/Low-Code

- Webflow, Bubble for web apps
- Airtable, Zapier for automation
- Glide, Adalo for mobile apps

### Development Frameworks

- React, Vue, Svelte for frontend
- Next.js, Astro for full-stack
- Firebase, Supabase for backend

## Best Practices

- Start with lowest fidelity that answers your question
- Test with real users, not colleagues or friends
- Build only what you need to learn
- Set clear success criteria before building
- Be ready to throw away and start over
