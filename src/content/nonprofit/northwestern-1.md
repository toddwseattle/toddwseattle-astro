I served on the board of trustees at [Northwestern University](https://northwestern.edu) as an Alumni Trustee for a single term. I served on the Alumni Relations and Development committee, where I led a task force to introduce class agent to increase participation. I also served on the tech transfer and entrpreneurship committee during the period when the [Northwestern Garage](https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/) was created.
