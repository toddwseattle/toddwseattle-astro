I started as General Manager of the Windows Embedded group in 2001 which managed a seperate business p and l building [Windows CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Embedded_Compact), specialized devices like the [Portable Media Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Media_Center), ultimately becoming the Corporate Vice President Reponsible for Development of [Windows Mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile), Windows CE, and Windows Automotive. During this period, We released Windows Mobile 6 and Windows Mobile 6.1 which powered millions of phones built by HTC, Samsung, and Motorola. We started several initiatives focused on device management and device update; and began to lay the foundation for what became Windows Phone.

Along the way, I led the turn around of the [Windows Automotive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Embedded_Automotived) group, the resulted in shipping a firmware updatable voice activated bluetooth car kit. This product shipped Windows automotive with key partners including Fiat (Blue and Me), Ford (Sync), and Hyundai as well as various tier 1s.

This stint also included managing the Mapping group, which did a pivot from a focus on b2b products to launching [Virtual Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Maps_Platform). The Virtual Earth team executed its strategy as one of the first groups at Microsoft to use Agile/Scrum; and formed a unique partnership with Microsoft Research to include digital imagery in its maps.
