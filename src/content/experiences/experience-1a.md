I joined Microsoft after undergrad as a Program Manager in the tools group. I was responsible for the release of MASM 5.1, Microsoft C 6.0, as well as working with the other languages products on shared development tools. I wrote some of the first user interface Specs for Developer Tools at Microsoft, specifically for CodeView 3.0 (most of the conventions we defined for data structure debugging are mimiced by debuggers today), the Programmer's Workbench--an early profession developer environment, and worked closely with the author to of 'Z' editor to release as 'M'.
