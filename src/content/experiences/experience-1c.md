With the introduction of Windows NT and it's related server applications, including Exchange and SQL Server, a need was identified to build commons services for experiences that crossed the server family; as well as building common products for distinct audiences that used the products together. This phase of my Microsoft Career I started as a group program manager and became the general manager of group that provided various common functions to the server applications; as well as created the distinct product bundles Small Business Server and BackOffice Server. At the time, Small Business Server was the fastest product to reach \$100m in revenue at Microsoft. I led this group from a proposal to more than 100 people. We provided the a set of shared services, including providing Systems Management UI via the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), UX Design and Research, and Developer SDK's and Developer programs.

Our developer work included providing the majority of the SDK content for the Microsoft Developer Network at the dawn of the internet.
