Ashesi University is focused on developing the next generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders in Africa. I've served on the board of the [Ashesi University Fondation](https://ashesi.org) since the boards formation. I was the chair of the board from 2012 to 2016. The institution during my board tenure has grown from serving 40 students to more than 2000; with thousands of productive graduates. During this time the board led multiple capital campaigns to build the initial campus and subsequent expansions for engineering and the sciences. I currently serve on the governance and nomination committees.
