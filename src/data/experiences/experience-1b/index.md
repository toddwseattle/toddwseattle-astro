I joined the email product management team when we had one product-Mac Mail. I worked with our 3rd party partners. After Microsoft acquired Consumer's Software to enter the PC Mail Business, I product managed many of its add-on products--"gateways" that connected to other legacy email systems. I led the product planning, positioning, and initial launch of Microsoft Exchange and the Microsoft Mail Client, as well as Schedule+ for Windows.
