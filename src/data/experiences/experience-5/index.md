I Teach in the [Northwestern McCormick School of Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/). In 2009, I taught software engineering in the computer science department. From 2010 to 2021 created and taught NUvention Web; a two quarter software entrepreneurship course where students build products and launch businesses.
